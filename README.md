# Search-Engine-Based-on-Pagerank
This is a search engine based on pagerank

Crawler crawls the web pages provided and gets all the required data
In this case instead of searching online i created an offline Search Engine

And then Indexer indexes all the pages in the database for quick searching

I created a very minimal gui which basically searches among the database provided

Here as an example i used crawler on a set of Wikipedia Web pages
