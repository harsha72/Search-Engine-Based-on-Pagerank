# Search-Engine-Based-on-Pagerank
This is a search engine based on pagerank

Crawler crawls the web pages provided and gets all the required data
In this case instead of searching online we created a offline Search Engine

And then Indexer indexes all the pages in the database for quick searching

We created a very minimal gui we basically searches among the database provided

Here as an example we have used crawler on a set of Wikipedia Web pages
